Anyone is free to use this or change this, however this products' sole intent is to be used for my computer science group project team!

Here is the framework for the bookstore application for your guys to tinker with. I suggest keeping a version of the base seperate and unchanged, then create a copy that you modify with your assigned task so it is easy to see what you've added! :) I also suggest using DB manager for SQLITE3 to look at the databases created by the application in detail and to help with troubleshooting! Good luck, happy coding!


Here was the discussion from the zoom call and the assigned tasks to each member! If you have any problems, please reach out to me or another member of the group!
